# FreelanceEscrow Smart Contract

## A Solidity smart contract for managing freelance jobs using an escrow system. It allows clients to post jobs with deposits, and freelancers to accept them. Funds are held in escrow until the job is completed, and then released to the freelancer.

## üõ† Features

- Clients create jobs with a deposit
- Freelancers accept jobs
- Clients mark jobs as completed
- Funds released securely to freelancers
- Jobs can be cancelled before acceptance (with refund)
- Events emitted for all state changes
- Reentrancy protection

## üß™ Testing the Contract

> You can interact with the contract directly in Remix after deployment:

### 1. Create a Job

- Set `value` (in ETH) > 0 in the Deploy tab
- Input parameters:

  - `_freelancer`: a valid address (not your own)
  - `_ipfsHash`: a sample IPFS hash (e.g., `"Qm...abc"`)

- Call `createJob(address, string)`
  ‚úÖ Emits `JobCreated`

### 2. Accept the Job

- Switch wallet to the freelancer account
- Call `acceptJob(jobId)`
  ‚úÖ Emits `JobAccepted`

### 3. Complete the Job

- Switch back to the client wallet
- Call `completeJob(jobId)`
  ‚úÖ Emits `JobCompleted`

### 4. Release Funds

- Call `releaseFunds(jobId)`
  ‚úÖ Emits `FundsReleased` and transfers ETH to freelancer

### 5. Cancel the Job

- Only possible before job is accepted
- Call `cancelJob(jobId)`
  ‚úÖ Emits `JobCancelled` and refunds client

### 6. View Functions

Use the following view functions to inspect the contract state:

- `getJob(jobId)`
- `getTotalJobs()`
- `getClientJobs(address)`
- `getFreelancerJobs(address)`

   - Right-click on `FreelanceEscrow.sol`, click **Flatten**

2. **Verify on Etherscan**

   - Go to [Etherscan Verify](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/verifyContract) (based on the testnet you deployed to)
   - Fill in:

     - Compiler version: 0.8.x
     - License: MIT

   - Paste flattened source code
   - Submit

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Make sure to **switch accounts** in MetaMask when simulating different roles (Client vs Freelancer)
- Always test with testnet ETH, not mainnet
